## Project idea: ÇöpRadar is a nationwide trash reporting platform. Take a photo of the trash, upload it, and it is INSTANTLY SENT to the municipality of that location based on the location.
# SO WHAT IS THIS ÇÖPRADAR?
## Thanks to ÇöpRadar, trash on the street is instantly reported to the municipality of that province (if supported).

# So, are we supposed to report every piece of trash we see!?
# Of course not. Here's what's required for it to be reported to the municipality:
## Trash smaller than the minimum size (10cm diameter) won't be reported.
## Trash cannot be in rural areas (rural areas are regions far from cities with low population density) or places inaccessible to municipalities (mountainous terrain or mountainous areas with no road access).
## Trash must be within Turkey's borders and in supported cities.







# Supported Municipalities and Cities:

## Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality,
 Izmir Metropolitan Municipality,
 Ankara Metropolitan Municipality,
 Mersin Metropolitan Municipality,
 Antalya Metropolitan Municipality,
 Bursa Metropolitan Municipality, 
 Sanliurfa Metropolitan Municipality,

# And as a pioneer, Eskisehir Metropolitan Municipality
